- The HTML code utilizes <div> elements to create structured containers for organizing and styling content on the webpage. These <div> elements are assigned specific class names to control their appearance, layout, and positioning. The "main," "color," "row," "column," "row2," and "column2" divs help create a visually appealing and organized presentation of information.
- Furthermore, a <table> element is used to display images in a two-column format, aligning them effectively within the layout. Images are placed within (table header) tags, resulting in a structured and visually pleasing arrangement of cryptocurrency images and descriptions.
