                    <h2>CryptoCurrency: </h2>
                    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A crypto-currency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange whereas individual coin ownership records are stored
					in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins,
					and to verify the transfer of coin oqnership. It typically does not exist in physical form and is typically not issued by a central
					authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central bankings systems.</p>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own
					currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them 
					as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.
					Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that
					manages and records transactions.</p>
                    <h3>Examples of Cryptocurrency</h3>

                          <h1>Bitcoin</h1>
                          <p>Bitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely 
						  virtual.It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user 
						  on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.</p>
                          <p>It's like an online version of cash. You can use it to buy products and services, but not many shops accept Bitcoin yet and some 
						  countries have banned it altogether.</p>

                          <h1>Ethereum</h1>
                          <p>Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own cryptocurrency, ether. It enables
						  SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ĐApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from 
						  a third party.</p>
                          <p>Ethereum is not just a platform but also a programming language (Turing complete) running on a blockchain, helping developers to
						  build and publish distributed applications.</p>

                          <h1>Litecoin</h1>
                          <p>Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Litecoin is an
						  open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network 
						  and empowers individuals to control their own finances. Litecoin features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage
						  efficiency than the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, trade volume and liquidity.</p>

                    <h2>Working of blockchain: </h2>
					<p>Transactions are sent between peers using software called “cryptocurrency wallets.” The person creating the transaction uses the wallet
					software to transfer balances from one account (AKA a public address) to another. To transfer funds, knowledge of a password
					(AKA a private key) associated with the account is needed. Transactions made between peers are encrypted and then broadcast to the 
					cryptocurrency’s network and queued up to be added to the public ledger. Transactions are then recorded on the public ledger via a 
					process called “mining”. </p>
					<BR>
                    <p> All users of a given cryptocurrency have access to the ledger if they choose to access it, for example by downloading and running a 
					copy of the software called a “full node” wallet (as opposed to holding their coins in a third party wallet like Coinbase). The 
					transaction amounts are public, but who sent the transaction is encrypted (transactions are pseudo-anonymous). Each transaction 
					leads back to a unique set of keys. </p>
					<BR>
                    <p> Whoever owns a set of keys, owns the amount of cryptocurrency associated with those keys (just like whoever owns a bank account owns 
					the money in it). Many transactions are added to a ledger at once. These “blocks” of transactions are added sequentially by miners. That
					is why the ledger and the technology behind it are called “block” “chain.” It is a “chain” of “blocks” of transactions. </p>
