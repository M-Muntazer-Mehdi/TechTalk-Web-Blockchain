                               <p>Blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:</p>
							   <div class="li">
                                   <li>Cryptographic Keys</li>
                                   <li>A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger</li>
                                   <li>A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network</li>
							    </div>
								<div class="dropdown">
                               <span>...LearnMore</span>
                               <div class="dropdown-content">
                               <h3>Cryptographic Keys:</h3>
                               <p>Cryptography keys consist of two keys: </p>
                               <ol>
                                    <li>Private Key</li>
                                    <li>Public Key</li>
                               </ol>
                                <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each
								individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity 
								is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to
								as ‘digital signature’ and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.</p>
								<BR>
                               <h3>Peer-to-Peer Network:</h3>
                               <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of
							   individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other
							   issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured
							   transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform
							   different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.</p>

                              <h3>Process of Transaction:</h3>
                              <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of Blockchain technology’s cardinal features is the way it confirms and authorizes
							  transactions. For example, if two individuals wish to perform a transaction with a private and public key, respectively,
							  the first person party would attach the transaction information to the public key of the second party. This total information
							  is gathered together into a block.</p>
                              <p>The block contains a digital signature, a timestamp, and other important, relevant information. It should be noted that the
							  block doesn’t include the identities of the individuals involved in the transaction. This block is then transmitted across all 
							  of the network's nodes, and when the right individual uses his private key and matches it with the block, the transaction gets 
							  completed successfully.</p>
                              <p>In addition to conducting financial transactions, the Blockchain can also hold transactional details of properties, vehicles,
							  etc.</p>
                              <p>Here's a use case that illustrates how Blockchain works:</p>
							  <div class="li">
                                  <li>Hash Encryptions</li>
                                  <li>Mining</li>

							  <h3> Hash Encryption </h3>
                              <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Blockchain technology uses hash encryption to secure the data, relying mainly on the SHA256 
							  algorithm to secure the information. The address of the sender (public key), the receiver’s address, the transaction, and his/her private key details
							  are transmitted via the SHA256 algorithm. The encrypted information, called hash encryption, is transmitted across the world
							  and added to the Blockchain after verification. The SHA256 algorithm makes it almost impossible to hack the hash encryption,
							  which in turn simplifies the sender and receiver’s authentication.</p>

							  algorithms. The transaction completes when the predetermined condition is met. To put it more plainly, Blockchain miners attempt 
							  to solve a mathematical puzzle, which is referred to as a proof of work problem. Whoever solves it first gets a reward.</p>

                                 <li>Nonce: An arbitrary number given in cryptography to differentiate the block’s hash address.</li>
                                 <li>Hash Address of the Block: All of the above (i.e., preceding hash, transaction details, and nonce) are transmitted 
								 through a hashing algorithm. This gives an output containing a 256-bit, 64 character length value, which is called the 
								 unique ‘hash address.’ Consequently, it is referred to as the hash of the block.</li>
