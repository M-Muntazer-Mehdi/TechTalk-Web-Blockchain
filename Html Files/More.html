                <tr>
                   <td><b>Data modification:</b>Another downside of blockchain systems is that once data has been added to the blockchain it is very difficult
				   to modify it. While stability is one of blockchain’s advantages, it is not always good. Changing blockchain data or code is usually very
				   demanding and often requires a hard fork, where one chain is abandoned, and a new one is taken up.</td>

               </tr>
              <tr>
                   <td> <b>Stability:</b>Confirmed blocks are very unlikely to be reversed, meaning that once data has been registered into the blockchain, it
				   is extremely difficult to remove or change it. This makes blockchain a great technology for storing financial records or any other data 
				   where an audit trail is required because every change is tracked and permanently recorded on a distributed and public ledger.</td>
                   <td> <b>Private keys:</b>Blockchain uses public-key (or asymmetric) cryptography to give users ownership over their cryptocurrency units 
				   (or any other blockchain data). Each blockchain address has a corresponding private key. While the address can be shared, the private key 
				   should be kept secret. Users need their private key to access their funds, meaning that they act as their own bank. If a user loses their 
				   private key, the money is effectively lost, and there is nothing they can do about it. </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                    <td><b> Trustless system: </b>In most traditional payment systems, transactions are not only dependent on the two parties involved, but
					also on an intermediary - such as a bank, credit card company, or payment provider. When using blockchain technology, this is no longer 
					necessary because the distributed network of nodes verify the transactions through a process known as mining. For this reason, Blockchain
					is often referred to as a 'trustless' system.  </td>
                   <td><b>Inefficient:</b>Blockchains, especially those using Proof of Work, are highly inefficient. Since mining is highly competitive and 
				   there is just one winner every ten minutes, the work of every other miner is wasted. As miners are continually trying to increase their 
				   computational power, so they have a greater chance of finding a valid block hash, the resources used by the Bitcoin network has increased 
				   significantly in the last few years. </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                   <td> <b> No Government Interference: </b>Blockchain technology can manage the major systems controlled by existing governments more 
				   efficiently. It can create, store, and always proceed with information on every single transaction.The government or any financial 
				   institution has zero control over virtual currencies that are based on blockchain technology. Government interference has often led to the
				   devaluation of various currencies and a good example of that is the latest Zimbabwean Dollar. </td>
                   <td><b>Storage:</b>Blockchain ledgers can grow very large over time. The Bitcoin blockchain currently requires around 200 GB of storage. 
				   The current growth in blockchain size appears to be outstripping the growth in hard drives and the network risks losing nodes if the ledger
				   becomes too large for individuals to download and store.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td> <b>Decentralization:</b> This is one of the primary benefits of this technology because, in a Blockchain-powered system, the need for 
				  third-party or intermediaries is eliminated by its working mechanism that manages the process of validating, verifying, and clearing the 
				  various transactions.</td>
                  <td> <b>Closing thoughts:</b>Despite the downsides, blockchain technology presents some unique advantages, and it is here to stay. We still 
				  have a long road to mainstream adoption, but many industries are getting to grips with the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain
				  systems. The next few years will likely see businesses and governments experimenting with new applications to find out where blockchain 
				  technology adds the most value. </td>
