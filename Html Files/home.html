                <h3>What is blockchain technology? </h3>
				<p> Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public
				in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage
				is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.
				Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction
				and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure
				In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which,
				the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but
				they can’t corrupt it. </p>

				<p> Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a
				business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights,
				branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for 
				all involved </p>

                <h3>  Why blockchain is important? </h3>
				<p> Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for
				delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared, and completely transparent information stored on an
				immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments,
				accounts, production, and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a
				transaction end-to-end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities. </p>

				<p> By spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate 
				without the need for a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also eliminates many of the processing and transaction fees.
				It can also give those in countries with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency with more applications
				and a wider network of individuals and institutions they can do business with, both domestically and internationally. </p>
